# Adversarial Weight Perturbation Improves Generalization in Graph Neural Network (AAAI 23)
This repository contains code for the paper Adversarial Weight Perturbation Improves Generalization in Graph Neural Network by Yihan Wu, Aleksandar Bojchevski, and Heng Huang. The code is forked from the publicly-available library DeepRobust(https://github.com/DSE-MSU/DeepRobust).

Our code is bulit upon the DeepRobust library, we provide several demos of our WT-AWP algorithm on the semi-supervised node classification tasks.
